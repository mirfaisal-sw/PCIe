Decoding: -
---------------
Note -  lspci data is stored in Little endian.

Vendor ID - 0x12be
Product ID - 0xbd31

Status register (Offset 0x06) - 0x0010 (Bit-3 set to 1, indicates that device has a pointer to the capabilities list ).
 
Capability pointer (offset 0x34) - 0x00000048
Next capability (offset 0x48) - 0x06035801    ( Capability ID - 0x01, Next Capability pointer - 0x58)
Next capability (offset 0x58) - 0x008a6805	  ( Capability ID - 0x05, Next Capability pointer - 0x68) 
        So, MSI Capability register value -  0x008a6805
		    MSI Message Control field - 0x008a (As Bit-0 is 0, so MSI is disable,
                                                   Bit-23 is 1, so 64bit addressing capable)			
		MSI Message address - 0x00000000
