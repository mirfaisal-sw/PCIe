I/O devices use a third kind of address: a "bus address".  If a device has
registers at an MMIO address, or if it performs DMA to read or write system
memory, the addresses used by the device are bus addresses.  In some
systems, bus addresses are identical to CPU physical addresses, but in
general they are not.  IOMMUs and host bridges can produce arbitrary
mappings between physical and bus addresses.

From a device's point of view, DMA uses the bus address space, but it may
be restricted to a subset of that space.  For example, even if a system
supports 64-bit addresses for main memory and PCI BARs, it may use an IOMMU
so devices only need to use 32-bit DMA addresses.
