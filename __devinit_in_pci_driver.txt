__init: Initialization code. Thrown away after the driver initializes.
__exit: Exit code. Ignored for non-modular drivers.

__devinit: Device initialization code used for hotplug drivers. It is identical to
			__init if the kernel is not compiled with CONFIG_HOTPLUG, normal
			function otherwise.
			
__devexit: The same for __exit. 
			Note: Pointers to functions marked as __devexit must be created using
			__devexit_p(function_name). It will generate the function name or NULL if
			the __devexit function will be discarded.
			
Tips: 
-------
1. The struct pci_driver shouldn't be marked with __init or __exit.
	The ID table array should be marked __devinitdata. The probe() and remove() functions
	(and all initialization functions called only from these) should be marked __devinit
	or __devexit.
	If you are sure the driver is not a hotplug driver then use only __init/ __exit 
	or __initdata/ __exitdata.

	Pointers to functions marked as __devexit must be created using __devexit_p(function_name).
	It will generate the function name or NULL if the __devexit function will be discarded.
